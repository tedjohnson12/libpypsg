Welcome to ``pypsg``!
=====================

``pypsg`` is a Python wrapper for the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG). PSG is
used widely by astronomers and planetary scientists to create synthetic spectra
of exoplanets and solar system objects. The goal of this package is to make
PSG more accessible to new users, but still be powerful enough that expert
users will find it useful.
